# A Simple Hangman Game in Python

A fun and simple Python project I did during the strange period of lockdown due to Covid-19 in ealry 2020, to get my mind off things.

The aim was to take a simple project and practice some of the foundations of Python with it.

To Do:
- Add pygame for GUI experience
- Ask for preferences at startup - difficulty level, GUI/CLI
- Embed on website
- Easy way to package so can be run without explicit python3 installation on machines
